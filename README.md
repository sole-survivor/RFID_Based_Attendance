# RFID Based Attendance
A simple RFID Based Attendance system using UART.<br>
In the Main_RFID.c, just replace the "KARNAN" "NAPOLEON" and "BHAGATH SINGH" with your Usernames and replace the IDs with the ones available in the RFID Reader Card and all set! The output can be seen on both UART Terminal Window as well as on a 4-Bit Alphanumeric LCD Display. This Project was done on the ARM-Based LPC2129 Microcontroller.
